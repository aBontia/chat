Thanks for helping out!

## Students

I **do not** expect you to understand everything going on in this repo. In fact, you should ignore every file and command with the few exceptions I give you. Unless you deem it absolutely necessary, do not go down any rabbit holes that are not directly related to Firebase, React, or anything we have already learned.

I do expect you to be able to do the following:

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/mattborn/bloc-chat) to your GitHub account. _Hint: click the Fork button in the upper right_
2. Pull your forked repo to your local environment and get the demo running in your browser. _Hint: `npm install` once, then `builder run open-hot` every time you start working on this_
3. Make changes to React component files in `src/components`.
4. Create pull requests from your forked repo to the master branch on [my repo](https://github.com/mattborn/bloc-chat).
5. [Create new issues](https://github.com/mattborn/bloc-chat/issues) for ideas you have to improve the chat experience.
6. Participate in [issue discussions](https://github.com/mattborn/bloc-chat/issues) and code reviews on [pull requests](https://github.com/mattborn/bloc-chat/pulls).
7. Mention your involvement on this project in your portfolio.
